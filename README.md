# SoundCloud Clone

Duckir Beats is a full-stack application that is based on SoundCloud. In Duckie Beats, a user is able to listen and see all songs made on the app. Additionally, the user is able to create, update and delete songs. Every song has a comment section that non-users are able to see, but only logged-in users are able to create and delete. Visit [Raptor Music](https://sebastian-soundcloud.herokuapp.com/) to start creating the next big thing!
